* Notes:
	* SQL database world is far more mature: reliable, scalable, deployable
	* NoSQL database is still quite young
	* Terminology is still in flux
	* Traditional databases, e.g. Postgress, are starting to build in nosql-like features
	* Future is not totally clear
* When to consider NoSQL databases
	* When the rigid schema becomes a problem
	* Classic example: When a user profile has a multitude of optional collection of properties.
* Terminology (MongdoDB)
	* Collection: A collection in mongodb is same as a table in mysql or oracle.
	* Document: A document in mongodb is same as a row or record in any rdbms.
