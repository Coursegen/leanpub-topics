#### How a web server works
* Review of some basic concepts
  * Client and Server
  * Client asks for a page; server sends a page
  * Web server receives the request and creates the page and sends it back
* A level deeper:
  * Server (usually) looks inside a database for information
  * And runs an algorithm on that to create the output
  * And that's what gets sent back.
